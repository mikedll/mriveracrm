    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My personality has three prime M.O.s: quietly contemplative, hesitantly analytical, and stupid and funny.
	      </p>
      
      <p>I grew up in Pasadena, California. I went to college for 1.5 years at Iowa State and for 3 years at UC Riverside. I majored in Computer Science. 
	      </p>

      <p>I'm good at telling stories and making people laugh, and I would enjoy learning stand-up comedy and improv. I'm competent with math, swimming, and dancing, and I'm aspiring to be an instructor in one of these disciplines.
        </p>

      <p>I'm bad at some things. From 2004 to 2008, I permitted myself to shatter my circadian rhythm. I've improved since then, but I still struggle with insomnia due to nervousness, stress, and daydreaming while in bed. In most areas of my life, I hesitate a lot. It takes me a long time to read a book.
        </p>

      <p>Here is some music I listen to: Rock, Eels, Cartel, Alkaline Trio, Melody Club, Green Day, U2, The Sounds, Pop, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, Rihanna, Regina Spektor, MIA, Michael Jackson, Coldplay, dancable music (jive, cha cha, samba, swing, WCS, waltz, v waltz), trance, Juno Reactor, Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, Massive Attack, Rob Dougan, Dido, Moby, Postal Service, classical, Jami Sieber, Joshua Bell, Hilary Hahn
        </p>

      <p>I like gentle, analytical writers like CS Lewis and Bertrand Russell.
        </p>

      <p>My favorite time to talk to someone is while we are working on something together. Although I enjoy it, I rarely socialize, and usually only with my immediate family or someone new. I tend to communicate through email or phone. The best way to get in touch with me is by email, or by messaging me on Facebook.
        </p>

      <p>My favorite ladies - the ones I find the most beautiful - are Melanie Waite, Amy Pierceall, Jen
      Diaz, and Shimkiri Syiem. They make me feel happy, emotional, and irrational.
        </p>

      <p>When I die, it should be straightforward to clean up after me.
        I own relatively few things and have no dependents.
        Afterwards, anyone is welcome to help themselves to my belongings
        (where convenient to them, my parents take priority).
        </p>

      <p>I do not believe that my life is too short. It is more than I ever deserved.
        </p>
