      I'm Mike and I work independently as a software product
      developer.  I started on December 13th, 2010 in Monterey,
      California, and now live in Anza, California. The scenic pictures
      you see in the background are from those two small towns.

      My main development machine has 32GB of RAM, 500GB of SSD space,
      4 processors, and two 23 inch monitors. It's ready with Windows
      7 and can run multiple Linux VMs without any performance
      issues. Additionally, I have an 8GB RAM MacBook Pro that dual
      boots into both Windows 7 and OS X. I understand why log(n) is
      better than n and way better than (n^2).  I occasionally produce
      instructional videos or articles on my blog. One of my blogposts is the #8 Google
      search result for "red black trees python".
