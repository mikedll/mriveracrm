    The Mike De La Loza Company

  #missionstatement

    %p 
      I'm Mike and I work independently as a software product
      developer.  I started on December 13th, 2010 in Monterey,
      California, and now live in Anza, California. The scenic pictures
      you see in the background are from those two small towns.

    %p
      I'm available for hire as a contractor.

    %p
      My development machine has 32GB of RAM, 500GB of SSD space, 4
      processors, and two 23 inch monitors. I have a MacBook Pro for
      testing sites with Safari. I understand why log(n) is better
      than n and way better than (n^2). My blogpost is the #8 Google
      search result for "red black trees python".
      
    %p
      Tech I work with: Linux, .NET, Apache, MySQL, Perl, Python, PHP,
      JavaScript, OpenGL, C/C++, Java, Scala, Visual Basic,
      MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Git, Ruby on Rails, Haml/Sass, jQuery, CoffeeScript, Android and Objective-C.
