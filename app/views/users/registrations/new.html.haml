        The business handle is an alphanumeric string that will be
        used in web URLs here on the CRM.  It must consist only of
        lower case letters and numbers, and it should
        describe your business. Example 'rocketfoodies',
        'lisaandrewsspa', 'newenglandfishery', 'hipcorgishow'.
